# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset when you want to release changes.
